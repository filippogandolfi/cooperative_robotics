# Cooperative Robotics
The goal of the course is to first introduce a modern task-priority based control of complex robotic systems such as dual arm robots, mobile manipulators, floating underwater vehicle-manipulator systems are characterized by a high number of degrees of freedom. Then the same framework is extended to the case where multiple robots need to work together, for example to manipulate and transport objects cooperatively
